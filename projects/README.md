  + [robosec.org](https://robosec.org) - A repository for the output of a joint research on *Industrial Robots Security* by Politecnico di Milano, and Trend Micro, Inc.

  + [Awesome thesis](https://github.com/ocean1/awesome-thesis) - While (co-)advising theses, I often suggest several resources to students, and decided to put together a list, that will help them during the process of developing their CS master thesis.

  + [Crave](https://github.com/necst/crave) - crAVe is a framework developed at NECSTLab to automatically test and explore the capabilities of generic AV engines. It's been developed in order to fuel further research, easing the development of scripts to manipulate malware, submit them to scanners (i.e., VirusTotal), retrieve, and analyze results.
