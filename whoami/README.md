# About me

I am ***_ocean*** aka Davide Quarta. 

I currently work as a Chip Security Architect at Fortaegis.
Before that I worked as a Product Security Engineer in Qualcomm.

In my past academic life I've been a Postdoctoral Researcher working in the [System Security group](http://www.s3.eurecom.fr) under the supervision of [Davide Balzarotti](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/). I received my PhD from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) where I worked in the [NECSTLab](https://necst.it/) under the supervision of [Stefano Zanero](http://home.deib.polimi.it/zanero/) and [Federico Maggi](https://maggi.cc/). During this journey, I co-advised more than 10 students on their master thesis, and projects.
I received my *Laurea Magistrale* in Software and Digital Systems, and *Laurea* from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/).

As a Marie-Skłodowska Curie alumni, I've been an exchange student at UC Santa Barbara' [SecLab](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/), working under the supervision of [Giovanni Vigna](https://cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/) and [Christopher Kruegel](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~chris/). At the end of my PhD I had a chance to work as an engineering intern in Qualcomm' Product Security group under the supervision of [Pouyan Sepehrdad](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I-kR9XsAAAAJ). I served as a reviewer for several journals, and as part of the Security&amp;Privacy '18 student program committee, and WOOT '19 Artifact Evaluation Committee.

I love teaching: I worked as *TA* in basic programming, and computer security courses. As a freelance consultant I teached malware analysis, and mobile and windows reverse engineering for the [Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale per l'Informatica](https://www.consorzio-cini.it), and national, and international clients of Italian security firms [Secure Network](https://www.securenetwork.it), and [Shorr Kan](http://www.shorr-kan.com/).

I play(ed) CTFs with several teams: TowerOfHanoi, Shellphish, and Mhackeroni and co-organized PoliCTF 2015, and developed challenges for iCTF 2017 and 2018.

I love Reverse Engineering in <a href="/projects/#rom-hacking">all of its forms</a>. I worked on mobile malware analysis as a *Research Assistant* in Politecnico di Milano, working on the <a href="https://andrototal.org">Andrototal</a> project. I also worked on windows malware analysis as a freelance consultant. 
I love thinkering with things, understand how they work, and I believe that science should be reproducible, and accessible. These ideas and topic resonated with [Andrea Continella](https://conand.me/), and we started developing the <a href="projects/#crave">CrAVe</a> project in order to develop a deeper understanding of anti-malware solutions, and how they are impacted by evasive malware.
My main topic as a PhD has been the security <a href="https://robosec.org">Smart manufacturing systems (Industrial Robots)</a> and more in general on the inherent security challenges posed by IoT and embedded systems at large.

I also served as a reviewer for multiple venues:

  + IEEE S&amp;P [student PC](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2018/studentpc.html) – 2018
  + IJIS – 2018
  + Elsevier COSE – 2017, 2018, ... 
  + CyberICPS – 2017
  + WISTP – 2015, 2017
  + EuroSec – 2015
  + ICISS – 2014, 2015, 2016
