# üëã Hi there! 
I'm ocean aka Davide Quarta.
I find vulnerabilities where bits meet atoms ‚Äî from **industrial robots** (5 CVEs in ABB/Universal Robots) to **IoT protocols** (Eclipse Mosquitto).

I'm a **Chip Security Architect at Fortaegis** with a passion for breaking and securing systems across the hardware-software boundary. Previously, I worked as a Product Security Engineer at Qualcomm. As a **Marie-Sk≈Çodowska Curie alumni** with a PhD from Politecnico di Milano, I've collaborated with top security labs including UC Santa Barbara's SecLab.
I've co-advised 10+ master students and taught malware analysis and reverse engineering internationally.

# üíª Open Source & Community

I developed several open source projects spanning different areas from AI/ML, security tools, and developer utilities.
I've contributed to major projects like **AFLplusplus**, **angr**, **Celery**, and **pwntools**.

I play(ed) CTFs with **TowerOfHanoi**, **Shellphish**, and **Mhackeroni**, co-organized PoliCTF 2015, and developed challenges for iCTF.

# üîç Research Interests

- **Embedded & IoT Security**: From ROM hacking on Game Boy to securing industrial control systems
- **Binary Analysis & Fuzzing**: Novel techniques for vulnerability discovery
- **Reverse Engineering**: Mobile/Windows malware, anti-malware evasion (CrAVe project)
- **AI/ML Security**: Exploring LLM assistant personas "transfer protocols", neural network approaches for image generation, and security research (with ML techniques, and for ML!).

I believe science should be reproducible and accessible, which drives my commitment to open source and education.

üì´ Feel free to reach out for collaborations, security research, or just to chat about reverse engineering!
